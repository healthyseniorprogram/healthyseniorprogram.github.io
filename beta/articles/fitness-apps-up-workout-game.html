	          <h2>Can you download a better body? Maybe not, but you can load your smartphone or tablet with tools to help you develop one for yourself.</h2>
	          <p>Today's smartphones and tablets have the ability to act as a personal trainer, nutrition coach, sleep tracker, and more. In a study of 726 people, those who were currently using exercise apps were more likely to work out during their free time than those who never used such apps or who had stopped using the ones they'd downloaded.</p>
	          <p>Ready to optimize your health-and-fitness routine? These apps have ranked high on many top fitness app lists and are still going strong. Most are free on iOS and Android (some offer subscription/premium options too).</p>
	          <p><strong>Couch to 5K&reg;</strong> ($2.99) is a running app created by Active that has helped thousands of beginners cross the finish line of their first race. All it takes is 30 minutes a day, three days a week for nine weeks. For motivation, choose your own virtual coach from a library of personalities. (TV army vet Sergeant Block and a former Couch to 5K alum named Constance are two options.) The app also syncs with your playlists and uses your phone's GPS to track your pace.</p>
	          <p><strong>Fitbit Coach</strong> by Fitbit lets you plug in your exercise preferences and goals, then serves up a customized workout. Videos offer a visual guide and coach you step-by-step through each move. Hundreds of exercises mean you never have to repeat a routine.</p>
	          <p><strong>JEFIT</strong> is the number one data-driven workout app for all levels of exercisers. If you've got a gym membership but just can't seem to get motivated—or you're new to working out—this tool can help. A database of more than 1,300 exercises lets you create personalized workouts, or you can do one of the seventy JEFIT Team workout routines. Track the amount you lift, the number of reps, and your rest time. Then access the info from a PC or phone anytime to see how you're progressing.</p>
	          <p><strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson Official 7 Minute Workout&reg; App</strong> has been downloaded more than 2 million times. The routines were designed by Chris Jordan, director of exercise physiology at the Johnson & Johnson Human Performance Institute, and feature 72 exercises and 22 workouts. Start at seven minutes or choose a longer or more intense option. Sync it with music from your iTunes library.</p>
	          <p><strong>MyFitnessPal</strong> by Under Armour is the free calorie-counting app that helped Tamara, a 31-year-old mother of two, lose 141 pounds (down from 278). Not only does it give you access to counts for more than 5 million foods—making it the world's largest nutrition and calorie database—you can also add recipes you find elsewhere.</p>
	          <p><strong>Pocket Yoga&trade;</strong> ($2.99) allows you to practice yoga at home or on the go, even when you're out of wi-fi range. A searchable dictionary of poses lets you double-check if you're doing the moves correctly in class. (Check that posture and alignment!) Take a full app-class or just strike a pose or two. It's all up to you, and you'll find options for different practices and skill levels. As you progress, you'll unlock new “environments” (backgrounds) to help you transport yourself outside of your daily stress zone. Namaste.</p>
