            <p>If your desire to eat is on the wane, follow these six steps to stay healthy and energized.</p>
			<p>Decreased appetite or unintentional weight loss is a serious symptom of all sorts of medical conditions, including certain cancers, depression, and dementia, to name just a few. It's also a side effect of many medications. While it's understandable that you'd want to avoid eating if you're not really hungry, experts say you must.</p>
			<p>"Food is fuel for all of the body's functions," says registered dietitian Rahaf Al Bochi, the owner of Olive Tree Nutrition in Atlanta and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. If you shortchange your nutritional needs long enough, your blood sugar level can drop too low, you risk losing crucial muscle mass, dehydration and fatigue become a concern, and your immune system will take a hit.</p>
			<p>The nutritional advice to help you stay healthy should be tailored to the root cause of your appetite loss and your medical history, says Al Bochi, but there are some general guidelines that apply across the board.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Eat smaller, more frequent meals.</strong> "Even if food is the last thing you want to see, sit down to the three regular meals, plus two or three snacks," says Al Bochi. Continuing with a mealtime routine will cue your body to expect and accept some food.</li>
				<li><strong>Cover most food groups.</strong> A mix of carbohydrates and protein will give you sustained energy. Good options to try include whole­grain crackers, beans, yogurt, vegetable soup, peanut butter, and lean meat. "If you find one or a few foods that you do enjoy more, it's OK to eat them as often as you'd like," says Al Bochi. "This is the time to listen to your body."</li>
				<li><strong>Keep ready­-to­-serve foods on hand.</strong> Chances are if you don't want to eat, you don't want to cook either. Stock up on easily accessible single­serving snacks, like pudding and trail mix.</li>
				<li><strong>Try real food first.</strong> Meal­ replacement drinks are a good option, but they don't offer all the benefits of whole foods. "Meal replacements have important nutrients, but they're not filling," says Al Bochi. "Think of them as a between-­meals option."</li>
				<li><strong>Don't rush.</strong> Give yourself plenty of time to complete as much of a meal as possible, preferably in a pleasant environment.</li>
				<li><strong>Eat with others.</strong> Sharing a meal with a friend or loved ones can help you look forward to mealtime and may make it easier to eat a little more.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>An Important Word for Caregivers: Don't Push It</h3>
			<p>Forcing food on your loved one or nagging them to eat will likely backfire, says Al Bochi. "Sometimes the best thing you can do is offer a good meal that you know they've enjoyed in the past," she says. "And make time to sit down with them at the table." If they eat, wonderful. If not, you've shown them you care.</p>
