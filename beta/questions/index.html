            <h3>What is the Healthy Senior Program?</h3>
            <p>The Healthy Senior Program is a trial (one-time test program) offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan to select Blue Cross Medicare Advantage members. This free program gives you Garmin V&iacute;vofit&reg; 4 fitness tracker (which is yours to keep) and access to a step-tracking and group fitness challenge application (app) called MoveSpring. The MoveSpring app has a mood indicator and an associated "Talk" feature where you can connect with Healthy Senior representatives about anything on your mind.</p>
			<p>Benefits of the pilot program:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>No additional cost to members</li>
            	<li>Participation does not affect your rates or future claims</li>
            	<li>Free wearable device to track activity, and access to a Healthy Senior representative</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why are you giving me a free wearable Garmin V&iacute;vofit 4?</h3>
            <p>Blue Cross is always looking for innovative ways to provide better service to its members. This pilot program is one of the new ideas we had to give you more for your health care coverage. As part of the program, we are giving away the Garmin V&iacute;vofit to people who choose to participate. When the pilot is done, the Garmin is yours to keep.</p>

            <h3>Are there any downsides of participating in the Healthy Senior Program?</h3>
            <p>No. The Healthy Senior Program has no penalties, no fees, and no effect on your rates or future claims. The pilot program is completely optional. You may stop participating at any time. The Garmin is yours to keep.</p>
            
            <h3>How long does the trial last?</h3>
            <p>The Healthy Senior Program is a four-month trial, starting July 1, 2018, and going through October 31, 2018.</p>
            
            <h3>Will my information be kept private?</h3>
            <p>Yes, all information is stored in a highly secured manner. The security of your information is of utmost importance to Blue Cross.</p>
            
            <h3>Who will see my information?</h3>
            <p>Blue Cross will see your information from Garmin, the MoveSpring app, and the call center. Garmin, the MoveSpring app, and the call center staff will also have access to information you provide to them, but they will not share that information with anyone else.  Other participants in the program will not have access to your personal information, such as your full name, mailing address, email address or phone number.  However, other participants will be able to see your public profile information, such as your MoveSpring username and the photo you provided for the app (if applicable).</p>
            
            <h3>Will my information be shared?</h3>
            <p>Blue Cross may share aggregated information with providers who treat members that participate in the program. The information would be shared for health care operations and treatment purposes.  The information will not be linked to any personal information that can identify any individual program participant. Blue Cross will use the aggregate results of this study to evaluate this trial.  Your individual results from this trial will not be used in any way that impacts your insurance benefits or coverage.</p>
            
            <h3>How was I selected?</h3>
            <p>A small group with the most potential to benefit was selected for the Healthy Senior Program. We hope you choose to enroll!</p>
            
            <h3>How do I enroll in the Healthy Senior Program?</h3>
            <p>If you are selected, a Healthy Senior representative will call you to schedule you for an enrollment seminar or will enroll you over the phone. You will also receive information about the Healthy Senior Program in the mail.</p>
            <p>Only members selected for this pilot program can enroll at this time.</p>	
            
            <h3>When and how do I get the Garmin V&iacute;vofit 4?</h3>
            <p>After enrollment, your Garmin V&iacute;vofit device will be shipped to you. You can expect to get it seven to 10 business days after enrolling. You can start using the device right away.</p>
            
            
            <h3>What does the Garmin Vivofit 4 do?</h3>
            <p>The Garmin V&iacute;vofit 4 is a fitness band that tracks steps, distance, calories, and sleep. It sends beeps to remind you to move during periods of prolonged sitting. You can see tracked information on the MoveSpring app, and you can use this information to help you live a healthier lifestyle.</p>
            
            <h3>How do I set up the device?</h3>
            <p>We will mail detailed instructions on how to set up the device. If you have not received the instructions, please click <a href="how-it-works/">click here</a> to view the detailed instructions </p>

	        <h3>What is the MoveSpring app?</h3>
	        <p>The MoveSpring app is a fun, easy-to-use health app that includes group fitness challenges and can sync with the Garmin Vivofit 4 (or another fitness tracker) and help you see your tracked information over a longer period of time. You can also track your mood over time and make "Talk" requests.</p>
